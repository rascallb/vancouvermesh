Vancouver Mesh is a community group working to build a mesh network of solar-powered meshtastic radios in Vancouver, BC and the South Island area.

This network acts like a city-wide text messaging system, allowing people to communicate publicly or privately with anyone on the network. 

All of this happens without any external infrastructure - no power, no cell phone towers, no internet.
