### Reach out to collaborate: 
In the spirit of the technology, ideally your first stop for advice, radio-hardware, mods, custom cases, and more would be some friendly person within your local mesh.

This site and community aims to connect users, operators, ethusiasts, and creators working on meshtastic in the YVR area.

If you're doing cool things with meshtastic in Greater Vancouver we want to hear from you and promote your work to the local community.
