MeshtasticÂ® is a project that lets you use inexpensive LoRa radios as a long range off-grid communication platform in areas without existing or reliable communications infrastructure. This project is 100% community driven and open source! 

The radios automatically create a mesh to forward packets to neighbors (up to 3 hops from origin). The radios will optionally work with your phone, but no phone is required. 

Vancouver Mesh is working to build a mesh in our region that anyone can connect to. The intention is for this off-grid network to be available as an Emergency/Disaster response tool. 

One large advantage of Meshtastic over GMRS or Amateur radio services is that no license is required to use Meshtastic. Please note. Meshtastic is still in active development and should not be considered as a life-critical service.
